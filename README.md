# Project-Knights-Travails
Using [Breadth first search algorithm](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-bfs) to determine the shortest possible path for a knight chess piece to traverse to another square.
This project is based on JavaScript curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails)

## Requirements
1. Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
2. Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to  go off the board.
3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:

### Output
  knightMoves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]
  knightMoves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]
  knightMoves([3,3],[0,0]) == [[3,3],[1,2],[0,0]]

### User interface (Work in Progress)
